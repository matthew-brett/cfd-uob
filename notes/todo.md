# Stuff to do

* Changing code cells to text cells and vice versa.
* Can remove `notebooks/02/variables` at some point.
* Renumber section 07 and subsequent to 06 and subsequent (see SUMMARY)

## Teaching plan

### Data types, strings and variables

* Introduce strings
* Play with them, compare to variable names.
* Conversion between things.

### Selecting data

`np.logical_and`, `np.logical_or` in `combining_booleans` notebook.

Can go after conditionals, rather than in slopes etc section?

### Copy right

See `loc_left_copy_right`.
