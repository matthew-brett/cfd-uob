We have already covered some important parts of programming for data science,
such as [expressions](../02/Expressions), [variables](../02/Variables), [data
types](../03/data_types), [arrays](../03/Arrays) and [data
frames](../04/data_frams_intro).

In this section, you cover the last two building blocks you will need as
a foundation for your future analyses.

These are:

* [Writing functions](functions)
* [Conditional statements](conditional_statements)
